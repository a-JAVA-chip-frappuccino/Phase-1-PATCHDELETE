# Phase 1 Lecture 6: PATCH & DELETE Requests

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to code a `fetch` to update an object in a JSON file and another `fetch` to remove an object from a JSON file.

## Lesson Plan

1. Run `json-server --watch db.json` to start the JSON server.
2. Add an event listener to each character to update it upon submission of the form.
    - What is a **PATCH** request?
    - What trait should be updated here? Could you add more in the future?
    - Why must this endpoint be used?
3. Render the updated character to the screen.
4. Add an event listener to each character to remove it upon click of the button.
    - What is a **DELETE** request?
5. Remove the character's render from the screen.

## Looking Ahead

For the next two days, we will focus on reviewing projects in preparation for the Code Challenge.
